## SIMPLE FB LOGIN PAGE

## Introduction

- I have made this as a submission for Richpanel interview round. It's just to show that login part is working.
- I have created a Facebook login button in React to get the users name, email and picture. I have also added it to the component state and render the data.
- Deployement can be seen at: https://richpanel-helpdesk.vercel.app
- To check the main work, go to: https://github.com/Agrim77/rp-frontend

## Technology Used

- I have used react-facebook-login library to implement it.
